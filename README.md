# Kasim Yurt - Data Analyst & Machine Learning Enthusiast

## About Me
I am a final-year **Electronics and Communication Engineering** student at **Istanbul Technical University (ITU)** with a strong interest in **data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence**. My journey in data science started during my third and fourth years of university through courses like **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Neural Networks**. These courses provided me with hands-on experience in academic research and project development, leading me to work on an AI-driven project focused on **agriculture**.

During my internship at **Uyumsoft**, I gained experience in **web development** and **database management**, working with SQL-based data management, data retrieval, and table relationships. This experience solidified my passion for data analysis and business intelligence.

My goal is to advance beyond data analysis and work on more complex data science projects involving **predictive modeling, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence**.

## Skills & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python *(Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn)*
- **Databases:** SQL *(BigQuery, MSSQL, PostgreSQL)*
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau
- **Machine Learning & AI:** Regression, Classification, Neural Networks
- **Big Data & Analytics:** Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Forecasting

## Portfolio Projects
Here are some of my key projects demonstrating my skills in **data analysis, SQL, and machine learning**:

### 1. AI in Agriculture: Predicting Crop Yield
- **Goal:** Develop a machine learning model to predict crop yield based on environmental and soil data.
- **Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Results:** Built a predictive model that improved yield estimation accuracy by 15% compared to traditional methods.

### 2. A/B Testing for User Engagement Optimization
- **Goal:** Analyze user engagement and revenue impact of different feature updates.
- **Technologies:** SQL (BigQuery), Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Results:** Provided data-driven insights that led to a 10% increase in user retention.

### 3. Cleaning & Analyzing E-Commerce Data with SQL
- **Goal:** Clean and analyze a large dataset of e-commerce transactions to identify sales trends.
- **Technologies:** SQL (PostgreSQL, BigQuery), Python
- **Results:** Optimized database queries and identified key products driving revenue growth.
