# Kasim Yurt - Data Analyst & Machine Learning Enthusiast

## About Me
I am a final-year **Electronics and Communication Engineering** student at **Istanbul Technical University (ITU)** with a strong interest in **data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence**. My journey in data science started during my third and fourth years of university through courses like **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Neural Networks**. These courses provided me with hands-on experience in academic research and project development, leading me to work on an AI-driven project focused on **agriculture**.

During my internship at **Uyumsoft**, I gained experience in **web development** and **database management**, working with SQL-based data management, data retrieval, and table relationships. Additionally, I worked on an "Event Management System" project, focusing on database design, query optimization, and user interface development using **C# and ASP.NET MVC**.

My goal is to advance beyond data analysis and work on more complex data science projects involving **predictive modeling, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence**.

## Skills & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python *(Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn)*, C, C#, C++
- **Databases:** SQL *(BigQuery, SQL Server, PostgreSQL)*
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau
- **Machine Learning & AI:** Regression, Classification, Neural Networks
- **Big Data & Analytics:** Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Forecasting
- **Embedded Systems & Robotics:** Arduino, LTSpice, Proteus
